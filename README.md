# Federated learning models

### Details 
- This is being utilised as a part of a larger project of building a health app.
- The dataset comprises of parameters such as height, age, weight to calculate BMI and BMR
- BMI = weight(kgs)/height(m^2)
- BMR [Mifflin Joer Equation]
  - For men:
      - BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
  - For women:
      - BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161 

### Experimentation of Federated Learning with models 

- Linear Regression
- Multi Layer Perceptron
